# E-Commerce Sales & Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing e-commerce sales data using Python and some of its most powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly. It provides insights into customer purchasing behavior, peak sales periods, city-wise revenue distribution, product trends, and more.

## Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw sales data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify monthly sales trends
- Analyze city-wise performance
- Discover best-selling products
- Find correlations between price and quantity sold
- Understand hourly sales patterns

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains records of customer orders, including:
- Order ID
- Product
- Quantity Ordered
- Price Each
- Order Date
- Purchase Address

A sample dataset (`ecommerce_sales.csv`) is included with this repository.

## Features

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, converting date formats, and creating new features like city and hour.
